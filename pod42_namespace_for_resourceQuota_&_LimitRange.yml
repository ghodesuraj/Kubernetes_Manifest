#Namespace is a way to organize and manage resources within a cluster.
#It allows you to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams, isolate workloads, and apply resource quotas or security policies specific to each namespace.
#Essentially, namespaces provide a virtual cluster within a physical Kubernetes cluster.
#Use Cases for Namespaces:
#Multi-tenancy: When multiple teams or projects share a Kubernetes cluster, namespaces can be used to isolate their workloads.
#Resource Quotas: You can limit the resources (CPU, memory, etc.) available to a namespace to control how much of the clusterâ€™s resources the workloads in that namespace can consume.
#Separation of Environments: Different environments like development, testing, and production can each have their own namespaces.
