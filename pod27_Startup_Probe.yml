    description: Learning Startup Probe, Used to check whether the application inside the container has started properly. This probe is typically used for applications that have a long startup time. If a startup probe is configured, it disables liveness and readiness probes until the startup probe succeeds. It helps avoid prematurely restarting an application that takes a long time to start. After the startup probe succeeds, Kubernetes switches to using the liveness and readiness probes.
