# Secrets are objects used to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, API keys, SSH keys, or any piece of data that you do not want to expose in plain text within your configuration files or environment variables. Storing such sensitive information in a Secret allows Kubernetes to securely pass this data to your Pods without exposing it directly in the Pod or deployment configurations.
